## 🚀 What's New in This Script

In this dataset, we have made several key improvements:

- **OXE Standard Transformations** 🔄: We have integrated OXE's standard transformations to ensure uniformity across data.
- **Alignment of State and Action Information** 🤖: State and action information are now perfectly aligned, enhancing the clarity and coherence of the dataset.
- **Robot Type and Control Frequency** 📊: Annotations have been added for robot type and control frequency to improve dataset comprehensibility.
- **Joint Information** 🦾: Joint-specific details have been included to assist with fine-grained understanding.

## Installation

Download lerobot code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
```

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 and activate it, e.g. with [`miniconda`](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html):

```bash
conda create -y -n lerobot python=3.10
conda activate lerobot
```

Install 🤗 LeRobot:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Get started

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> 1.Before running the following code, modify `save_episode()` function in lerobot.
> ```python
> def save_episode(self, episode_data: dict | None = None, keep_images: bool | None = False) -> None:
>     ...
>     # delete images
>     if not keep_images:
>         img_dir = self.root / "images"
>         if img_dir.is_dir():
>             shutil.rmtree(self.root / "images")
>     ...
> ```
> 2.for `bc_z` dataset, modify `encode_video_frames()` in `lerobot/common/datasets/video_utils.py`.
> 
> ```python
> # add the following content to line 141:
> vf: str = "pad=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih/2)*2",
> # Add the following content to line 171:
> ffmpeg_args["-vf"] = vf
> ```

> [!TIP]
> We recommend using `libsvtav1` as the vcodec for ffmpeg when encoding videos during dataset conversion.

Compile FFmpeg with libsvtav1 encoder (Optional):

`libsvtav1` is only supported in higher version of ffmpeg, so many users need to compile ffmpeg to enable it. You can follow this [link](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide) for detailed compilation instructions..

Download source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tavish9/openx2lerobot.git
```

Modify path in `convert.sh`:

```bash
python openx_rlds.py \
    --raw-dir /path/to/droid/1.0.0 \
    --local-dir /path/to/LEROBOT_DATASET \
    --repo-id your_hf_id \
    --use-videos \
    --push-to-hub
```

Execute the script:

```bash
bash convert.sh
```

## Available OpenX_LeRobot Dataset

We have upload most of the OpenX datasets in [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/IPEC-COMMUNITY)🤗.

You can visualize the dataset in this [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/IPEC-COMMUNITY/openx_dataset_lerobot_v2.0).

## The `LeRobotDataset` format

A dataset in `LeRobotDataset` format is very simple to use. It can be loaded from a repository on the Hugging Face hub or a local folder simply with e.g. `dataset = LeRobotDataset("lerobot/aloha_static_coffee")` and can be indexed into like any Hugging Face and PyTorch dataset. For instance `dataset[0]` will retrieve a single temporal frame from the dataset containing observation(s) and an action as PyTorch tensors ready to be fed to a model.

A specificity of `LeRobotDataset` is that, rather than retrieving a single frame by its index, we can retrieve several frames based on their temporal relationship with the indexed frame, by setting `delta_timestamps` to a list of relative times with respect to the indexed frame. For example, with `delta_timestamps = {"observation.image": [-1, -0.5, -0.2, 0]}` one can retrieve, for a given index, 4 frames: 3 "previous" frames 1 second, 0.5 seconds, and 0.2 seconds before the indexed frame, and the indexed frame itself (corresponding to the 0 entry). See example [1_load_lerobot_dataset.py](examples/1_load_lerobot_dataset.py) for more details on `delta_timestamps`.

Under the hood, the `LeRobotDataset` format makes use of several ways to serialize data which can be useful to understand if you plan to work more closely with this format. We tried to make a flexible yet simple dataset format that would cover most type of features and specificities present in reinforcement learning and robotics, in simulation and in real-world, with a focus on cameras and robot states but easily extended to other types of sensory inputs as long as they can be represented by a tensor.

Here are the important details and internal structure organization of a typical `LeRobotDataset` instantiated with `dataset = LeRobotDataset("lerobot/aloha_static_coffee")`. The exact features will change from dataset to dataset but not the main aspects:

```
dataset attributes:
  ├ hf_dataset: a Hugging Face dataset (backed by Arrow/parquet). Typical features example:
  │  ├ observation.images.cam_high (VideoFrame):
  │  │   VideoFrame = {'path': path to a mp4 video, 'timestamp' (float32): timestamp in the video}
  │  ├ observation.state (list of float32): position of an arm joints (for instance)
  │  ... (more observations)
  │  ├ action (list of float32): goal position of an arm joints (for instance)
  │  ├ episode_index (int64): index of the episode for this sample
  │  ├ frame_index (int64): index of the frame for this sample in the episode ; starts at 0 for each episode
  │  ├ timestamp (float32): timestamp in the episode
  │  ├ next.done (bool): indicates the end of en episode ; True for the last frame in each episode
  │  └ index (int64): general index in the whole dataset
  ├ episode_data_index: contains 2 tensors with the start and end indices of each episode
  │  ├ from (1D int64 tensor): first frame index for each episode — shape (num episodes,) starts with 0
  │  └ to: (1D int64 tensor): last frame index for each episode — shape (num episodes,)
  ├ stats: a dictionary of statistics (max, mean, min, std) for each feature in the dataset, for instance
  │  ├ observation.images.cam_high: {'max': tensor with same number of dimensions (e.g. `(c, 1, 1)` for images, `(c,)` for states), etc.}
  │  ...
  ├ info: a dictionary of metadata on the dataset
  │  ├ codebase_version (str): this is to keep track of the codebase version the dataset was created with
  │  ├ fps (float): frame per second the dataset is recorded/synchronized to
  │  ├ video (bool): indicates if frames are encoded in mp4 video files to save space or stored as png files
  │  └ encoding (dict): if video, this documents the main options that were used with ffmpeg to encode the videos
  ├ videos_dir (Path): where the mp4 videos or png images are stored/accessed
  └ camera_keys (list of string): the keys to access camera features in the item returned by the dataset (e.g. `["observation.images.cam_high", ...]`)
```

A `LeRobotDataset` is serialised using several widespread file formats for each of its parts, namely:

- hf_dataset stored using Hugging Face datasets library serialization to parquet
- videos are stored in mp4 format to save space
- metadata are stored in plain json/jsonl files

Dataset can be uploaded/downloaded from the HuggingFace hub seamlessly. To work on a local dataset, you can use the `local_files_only` argument and specify its location with the `root` argument if it's not in the default `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot` location.
